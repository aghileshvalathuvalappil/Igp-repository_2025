## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

# Tidy version
tidy(model3)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))  # Arrange 4 plots in one window
plot(model3)
```
```{r}
library(plotly)

# using size and energy
model3 <- lm(`% dry after 24h in incubator` ~ `Droplet/particle size (µm)` + `Curing Energy (kJ g-1)`, data = df)

# Generate prediction grid
size_seq <- seq(min(df$`Droplet/particle size (µm)`, na.rm = TRUE),
                max(df$`Droplet/particle size (µm)`, na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 30)
curing_seq <- seq(min(df$`Curing Energy (kJ g-1)`, na.rm = TRUE),
                  max(df$`Curing Energy (kJ g-1)`, na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 30)

grid <- expand.grid(`Droplet/particle size (µm)` = size_seq,
                    `Curing Energy (kJ g-1)` = curing_seq)

# Predict % dry
grid$predicted <- predict(model3, newdata = grid)

# Reshape to matrix
z_matrix <- matrix(grid$predicted, nrow = 30, ncol = 30)

# 3D Plot
library(plotly)
plot_ly(x = ~size_seq, y = ~curing_seq, z = ~z_matrix) %>%
  add_surface() %>%
  layout(
    title = "% Dry vs Droplet Size and Curing Energy",
    scene = list(
      xaxis = list(title = "Droplet/Particle Size (µm)"),

## Model Diagnostic Summary

1) Residuals vs Fitted shows a curved pattern, indicating non-linearity in the model.

2) Q-Q Plot reveals deviations at the extremes, suggesting non-normal residuals, likely due to outliers or skewness.

3) Scale-Location Plot shows an upward trend, pointing to heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance).

4) Residuals vs Leverage identifies some influential points (e.g., 1, 106, 130, 140), though none are extreme outliers.

## Model Limitations

129 observations were dropped due to missing data—potentially weakening the model. Addressing this could improve reliability.

## What We Did

Built and evaluated simple and multiple regression models.

Checked key assumptions (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, influence).

Investigated how variables like curing energy and viscosity affect drying.

## Key Takeaways

p < 0.05 indicates strong relationships.

Higher R² = better model fit.
